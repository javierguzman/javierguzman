# Who am I?

My name is Javier Guzman, a software engineer living in Europe. I have an embedded software background and I have worked in the automotive, aerospace and telecom sectors.

In 2020 I moved into the web/mobile phone apps sector and made my first dive into the entrepreneur world. As a result of that I created Kindoi, a web app to get your travel itinerary sorted within seconds. A demo can be found on my personal website.

Currently, I work for a company while creating more apps.

# What projects am I working on?

Recently I have launched [Deploy Quick](https://deployquick.com) which offers Terraform blueprints so people can deploy on different providers quickly.

Right now I am baking the next idea.
