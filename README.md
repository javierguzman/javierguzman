# How am I?

My name is Javier Guzman, a software engineer living in Europe. I have an embedded software background and I have worked in the automotive, aerospace and telecom sectors.

In 2020 I moved into the web/mobile phone apps sector and made my first dive into the entrepreneur world. As a result of that I created Kindoi, a web app to get your travel itinerary sorted within seconds. A demo can be found on my personal website.

Currently, I am looking for a job while creating more apps.

# What projects am I working on?

I have recently launched [Little Tribe](https://www.littletribe.app). A React native app aiming to help traditional and non-traditional families find other families with similar interests. iOS release will come in future.

Also I have just started creating a new project, still to be announced, but the backend will use FastAPI so Python, there we go!
