# How am I?

My name is Javier Guzman and I am a software engineer living in Europe. I have an embedded software background and I have worked in the automotive, aerospace and telecom sectors.

I left my job to make a change in my career and move into the web application world. I like travel, photography, reading technical books and currently I am working on my own.

# What projects am I working on?

I was recently working on Kindoi; a web app to get your travel itinerary sorted within seconds. However, I have decided not to continue with the idea as I did not see the desired growth and there are millions of ideas waiting to be shipped. Now I am working on a React Native mobile phone app which I hope to have a MVP for February.
