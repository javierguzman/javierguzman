# How am I?

My name is Javier Guzman and I am a software engineer living in Europe. I have an embedded software background and I have worked in the automotive, aerospace and telecom sectors.

In 2020 I left my job to make a change in my career and move into the web application world. I wanted to create something by myself so I tried to create Kindoi, a web app to get your travel itinerary sorted within seconds. However, I have recently decided not to continue with the idea as I did not see the desired growth and there are millions of other ideas waiting to be shipped. I like travel, photography, reading technical books.

Currently I am looking for a job in the web development sector.
